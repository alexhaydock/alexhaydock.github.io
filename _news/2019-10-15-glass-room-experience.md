For Libraries Week this year, I helped co-host a version of Tactical Tech's <a href="https://theglassroom.org">_Glass Room Experience_</a> exhibit in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191016111727/http://theglassroom.org/event/outerwest">Outer West Library in Newcastle</a>. The Glass Room Experience is a smaller, more portable version of _The Glass Room_, which is a larger exhibit currently installed <a href="https://theglassroom.org/san-francisco">in San Francisco</a>, and which was has previously been installed in New York, in Berlin, and <a href="https://theglassroom.org/glassroomlondon">in London</a> in 2017, where I helped out by presenting some practical digital security workshops for members of the public.

The exhibit focuses on interactivity and creative ways of visualising data, and is designed for an audience who are casually passing-by. The interaction draws attention from the passing crowd, and people are encouraged to play with the pieces. The pieces help visitors to consider the amount of data they might be generating about themselves on a daily basis, and which companies might be motivated to collect it.

The overall goal of the exhibit is to create thought-provoking visualisations around user data and in-depth conversations about privacy, so I was on-hand during the exhibit to talk to interested visitors about the exhibit and about their own experiences and concerns with data privacy.

The pieces are all innovatively designed to be thought-provoking and educational. As visitors pass around the exhibit, they are prompted to consider the hidden motivations behind the huge amount of data that modern technology is generating about us, and to consider how they interact with it. Visitors can watch a selection of creative videos such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxygkyskucA">this one</a>, where a paid actor spends 9 hours reading all 73,198 words of the Amazon Kindle Terms and Conditions. Every piece encourages visitors to think about their online and data footprint in a creative way.

After viewing the exhibit, visitors are encouraged to try a 'data detox', using one of Tactical Tech's <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org">Data Detox Kits</a>. The kit lays out a number of practical and non-disruptive steps that visitors can take if they decide after viewing the exhibit that they would like to reduce their data footprint. The Data Detox Kit website has a logical layout that presents visitors with a number of easy options, such as changing the names of their devices with Bluetooth enabled, setting privacy settings on social media, and using two-factor authentication.

If you're in the San Francisco area, you can find information about the current Glass Room exhibit <a href="https://theglassroom.org/san-francisco">here</a>. In other parts of the world, you can <a href="https://theglassroom.org/events">see here</a> to check if there are any events near you. For everyone else, I fully recommend checking out the <a href="https://datadetoxkit.org">Data Detox Kit</a> site, for a high-level overview of some practical tips to regain control of some of your personal data.

We hope to bring the Glass Room Experience to more North East libraries over the coming months, so stay tuned!
