description: They trust me. Dumb fucks. â€” Mark Zuckerberg
---
This page is my apology and explanation for those of you who might be wondering why I haven't replied to your Facebook messages or friend requests (sorry!).

With 2.5bn users, it's increasingly difficult to survive without a Facebook account. I do have one (rather begrudgingly), but I rarely sign in and don't check notifications particularly often.

I **very strongly** encourage people to use alternative platforms wherever and whenever possible. Socially I am far more active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajhdock), and for direct contact I have some details on the [main page of this site](/).

#### Why?
As a digital privacy researcher and campaigner, I extensively study the regulation and business models of platforms which deal primarily in user data.

I could probably talk for hours and hours about the reasons I have for trying to avoid Facebook and their business model. For my friends in real life, I have probably already done this to you. For everyone else, here's a few highlights:
* [Facebook combines your info with stuff it buys from data brokers to build-up a creepy profile of your entire life](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them).
* [Mark Zuckerberg lied to Congress about Facebook's data sharing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html).
* [Facebook specifically researched how to target "emotionally vulnerable" teenagers with ads](https://www.news.com.au/technology/online/social/leaked-document-reveals-facebook-conducted-research-to-target-emotionally-vulnerable-and-insecure-youth/news-story/d256f850be6b1c8a21aec6e32dae16fd).
* [Facebook's 'Real Name' policy unfairly discriminates against LGBT users, domestic abuse survivors, and others](https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/25/women-lgbt-safety-facebook-policy/).
* [...and they're so desperate to make sure it's your real name that they'll get your friends to snitch on you](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/).
* [Facebook pushes parents to identify their kids in photos, hooking children into the system before they're old enough to join](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/step-1-identify-baby-photo-step-2-hide-baby-photos/).
* [Facebook once allowed you to buy ads which would get shown to "Jew haters"](https://theintercept.com/2018/11/02/facebook-ads-white-supremacy-pittsburgh-shooting/).
* [...and their advertising algorithms are *still* racist](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/03/facebook-ad-algorithm-race-gender/).
