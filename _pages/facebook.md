This page is my apology and explanation for those of you who might be wondering why I haven't replied to your Facebook messages or friend requests (sorry!).

With 2.5bn users, it's increasingly difficult to survive without a Facebook account. I do have one (rather begrudgingly), but I rarely sign in and don't check notifications particularly often.

I **very strongly** encourage people to use alternative platforms wherever and whenever possible. Socially I am far more active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ajhdock), or there are some other ways to contact me [here](/).

#### Why?
As a digital privacy researcher and campaigner, I extensively study the regulation and business models of platforms like Facebook which deal primarily in collecting and selling the data of their users.

I could probably talk for hours and hours about the reasons I avoid endorsing Facebook or their business model. If you know me in real life, you've probably already sat through a few of those hours. For everyone else, here's just a few highlights:
* [Facebook combines your info with stuff it buys from data brokers to learn as much as it possibly can about you](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-doesnt-tell-users-everything-it-really-knows-about-them).
* [Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg lied to Congress about the company's data sharing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/03/technology/facebook-device-partners-users-friends-data.html).
* [Facebook experiments on users to see how far it can alter their emotional state](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds).
* [...and it specifically researched how to target ads to emotionally vulnerable teenagers who feel "worthless"](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/facebook-helped-advertisers-target-teens-who-feel-worthless/).
* [Facebook's detailed psychological profiling of users has worrying implications for democracy](https://theconversation.com/facebook-is-killing-democracy-with-its-personality-profiling-data-93611).
* [...and they even operate their own internal unit that uses your data to aid political campaigns](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-12-21/inside-the-facebook-team-helping-regimes-that-reach-out-and-crack-down).
* [Facebook once allowed anyone to buy ads which would get shown to "Jew haters"](https://theintercept.com/2018/11/02/facebook-ads-white-supremacy-pittsburgh-shooting/).
* [Facebook's advertising algorithms are *still* racist](https://theintercept.com/2019/04/03/facebook-ad-algorithm-race-gender/).
* [Facebook's 'Real Name' policy discriminates against LGBT users, domestic abuse survivors, and others](https://www.engadget.com/2015/06/25/women-lgbt-safety-facebook-policy/).
* [...and they're so desperate to make sure it's actually your real name that they'll get your friends to snitch on you](https://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/facebook-snitch-on-friends-that-arent-using-real-names/).
* [Facebook pushes you to identify your kids in photos, hooking children into the system before they're old enough to join](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/31/step-1-identify-baby-photo-step-2-hide-baby-photos/).
* [Just a small number of Facebook likes can accurately identify your race, your sexuality, and begin to predict your behaviour](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1218772110).
