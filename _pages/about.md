Hi, Iâ€™m Alex.

I am an information security and data protection consultant with a particular interest in user privacy, data protection & online censorship.

I currently carry out freelance consultancy work for groups and individuals who require the expertise of someone familiar with technology law as well as with the tech which it regulates. I was previously the Legal Officer for the [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/), in their London office.

I am also a Master in Law graduate with legal interests which include digital rights, civil liberties, and the regulation of technology and the internet.

I sometimes speak at events and meetups for people interested in digital security and privacy. More details about these events can be found on [this page](/events).

In my spare time, I tinker with computers and have been [learning photography](https://photos.alexhaydock.co.uk).
