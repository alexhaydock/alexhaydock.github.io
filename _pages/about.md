Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. I currently work as a Security, Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR) engineer.

Previously I provided (via this site) consulting services for security, data protection and privacy-enhancing tech. I'm not currently looking for new clients at the moment.

These days, I spend most of my day working with [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and a whole lot of containerisation / virtualisation technologies to make security monitoring a reality.

I am sometimes active on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexhaydock).
