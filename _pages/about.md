Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. I currently work as a Security, Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR) engineer in the energy sector.

Previously I provided security and privacy consulting services via this site. I'm not currently looking for new clients at the moment.

Day-to-day, I spend my time working with Splunk, Ansible, and all the bells and whistles that go into maintaining, administering, and monitoring performant "big data" deployments.

I love containers, [ComplianceAsCode](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode), immutable infrastructure, [BPF](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-06-15/bpf-internals.html), and auditd.

I am sometimes active on both [GitHub](https://github.com/alexhaydock) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock).
