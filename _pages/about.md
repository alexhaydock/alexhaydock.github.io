Hi, Iâ€™m Alex.

I am an information security and Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PET) consultant with a particular interest in user privacy and data protection.

I consult directly with businesses and individuals looking to put together materials explaining complex information security concepts in an accessible manner, and also with non-profits and civil society groups who are interested in technology public policy.

Most of my work involves taking complex technical topics and transforming them to meet the needs of specific audiences.

So if you need someone who is able to take complex privacy and security concepts and transform them for your specific audience, then please [get in contact](/contact)!

I also [sometimes speak at events](/events) and meetups for people interested in digital security and privacy.
