Hi, Iâ€™m Alex. I currently work as a Security, Orchestration, Automation & Response (SOAR) engineer in the energy sector.

Previously I provided security and privacy consulting services via this site. I'm not currently looking for new clients at the moment.

Day-to-day, I spend my time working with Splunk, Ansible, and all the bells and whistles that go into maintaining, administering, and monitoring performant "big data" deployments.

I love containers, immutable infrastructure, eBPF, and auditd.

I am sometimes active on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/alexhaydock) and [GitHub](https://github.com/alexhaydock).
