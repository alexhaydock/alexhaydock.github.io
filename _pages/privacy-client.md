This Privacy Notice applies to clients and prospective clients of my consultancy services. For policies applying to others, please see the [Privacy Overview](/privacy) page.

#### Overview
* I must process some information about you in order to provide my consultancy services, and for billing purposes.
* I will hold the information about you only for a reasonable time period and can delete most information sooner if requested.

#### Email
* When you communicate with me by email, I hold copies of these emails on servers owned by my email provider, [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/). You can verify my provider [here](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=mx%3aalexhaydock.co.uk&run=toolpage#).
* Emails stored on ProtonMail servers are encrypted and accessible [only by me and nobody else](https://protonmail.com/security-details) (not even server operators).
* I ensure that emails are destroyed after no longer than 1 year, except for emails regarding billing and invoices.
* Periodically, I will export backups of my emails to local machines under my control. All backups are stored on encrypted disks and also only accessible to myself.

#### Third-Party Services
* I often make use of [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/) to deliver and collaborate on documents, as many clients find this convenient. If you *do not* wish for me to use any Google services, then please let me know. I am happy to exchange documents using your preferred method and in your preferred format(s).

#### Retention Periods
* For the benefit of clients who may wish to request copies or further work, I retain digital copies of completed work for 1 year, after which I securely destroy all copies.
* You are very welcome to request a shorter retention period, or request that my copies are destroyed upon delivery of the work to you.
* Billing information and invoices are required for tax purposes and cannot be destroyed upon request. I will  retain these documents for at least 7 years.

#### Financial
* While billing information and invoices are kept intentionally, records of your financial identifiers (such as bank account and sort code number) are not. Such records are kept only as a consequence of transaction logs retained by my bank. Retention periods are therefore in accordance with those of my bank.
* I do not keep records of your financial identifiers outside of my banking transaction logs.
* For more information, please see the [Monzo Bank Privacy Policy](https://monzo.com/legal/privacy-notice/).
